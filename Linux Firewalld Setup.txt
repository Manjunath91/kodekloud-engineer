To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in future but for now we have decided to go with below given requirements:


a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port.

b. Allow incoming connections from LB host only on Apache port and block for rest.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already please make sure to start them.

	yum install firewalld -y
       systemctl start firewalld && systemctl enable firewalld && systemctl status firewalld
   47  firewall-cmd --state && firewall-cmd --reload
   48  cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
   49  firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-rich-rule 'rule family="ipv4" source address=172.16.238.14 port protocol="tcp" port="5004" accept'
   50   firewall-cmd --reload
   51  systemctl restart firewalld
   52  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
   53  systemctl restart httpd && systemctl enable httpd && systemctl status httpd
   54  systemctl restart nginx && systemctl enable nginx && systemctl status nginx
   55  cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   56  cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep listen
   57  firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8098/tcp
